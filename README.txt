The Lastlogin plugin will display the time of last login (more precisely: time of last action), the join date and user's GUID on the members' profile pages. The last login time shown will be either "online", "within last hour", "today" or the date in YYYY/MM/DD format. The join date and user's GUID can also be helpful for admins in finding a user's data subfolder in Elgg's tree structure of the data directory.

The items to be displayed on profile pages can be configured: for time of last login and join date the visibility can be set either to "no", "admin only" or "everybody" (separately for both items). For users' GUIDs only the options "no" or "admin only" are available.



Installation:

The client side needs to have a Java runtime environment plugin installed in their browser for the Java applets to work.

1. Copy the lastlogin folder in the mod directory of your Elgg installation,
2. Enable the plugin in the admin section and configure the lastlogin plugin settings.
